### Hi there I'm Mikai ğŸ‘‹

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Java, MATLAB, and Arduino C

- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Mechanical Engineering while also studying a minor in Computer Science. I am learning Java, MATLAB, Arduino C, and have learned Python already.

- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with finding projects that I can build to boost my resume/coding experience.

- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about where I am from and where I've been!
